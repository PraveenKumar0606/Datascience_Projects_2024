## Industrial Copper Modeling

### Description: ##
This approach outlines a comprehensive data preprocessing, exploration, feature engineering, and model building pipeline, followed by the creation of an interactive model GUI using Streamlit for predictive analysis and interpretation, enhancing the ML workflow efficiency and user experience. Additionally, it emphasizes model interpretability and scalability through techniques like hyperparameter optimization and pickling for model persistence.

## Introduction: ##
Utilizing supervised learning techniques, this project aims to predict the selling price through regression modeling and determine the status via classification modeling, facilitated by a Streamlit interface for user-friendly access to price and status predictions.

### Libraries/Modules Required ###
- import numpy as np: NumPy library imported and aliased as np for numerical computing.
- import pandas as pd: Pandas library imported and aliased as pd for data manipulation and analysis.
- import seaborn as sns: Seaborn library imported and aliased as sns for statistical data visualization.
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt: Matplotlib library imported and aliased as plt for creating plots and visualizations.
### For Regression Model and Classification model we have Various library and module from Scikit

### Approach: ###
- Understand data types and distributions, handle rubbish values, and treat categorical variables.
- Preprocess data by handling missing values, outliers, skewness, and encoding categorical variables.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize outliers and skewness.
- Engineer features, drop highly correlated columns, and visualize using seaborn heatmap.
- Build and evaluate classification models, optimize hyperparameters, and interpret results.
- Create a Streamlit GUI for interactive model usage with feature engineering and prediction capabilities
  
### Conclusion: ###
This project provides accurate predictions for both the product's selling price and status through the implementation of various machine learning techniques. With its user-friendly interface, it offers an accessible environment for users to interact with and make informed decisions based on the model's outputs.
