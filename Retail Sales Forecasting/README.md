# Sales Forecasting Project
## Overview
This sales forecasting project aims to address key objectives for optimizing department-wide sales at various stores, with a focus on enhancing predictive accuracy, modeling the impact of markdowns during holiday weeks, and providing actionable insights.
## Objectives:
1. **Predict Department-wide Sales:**
   - Develop robust models to forecast department-wide sales for each store for the upcoming year.
   - Utilize historical sales data, store-specific information, and relevant features to enhance prediction accuracy.
2. **Model Impact of Markdowns on Holiday Weeks:**
   - Investigate and model the specific effects of markdowns during holiday weeks on sales.
   - Identify patterns, correlations, and causal relationships to refine the forecasting models during holiday periods.
3. **Provide Actionable Insights:**
   - Derive meaningful insights from the forecasting models and markdown analysis.
   - Prioritize recommendations based on the potential business impact.
   - Offer clear, actionable steps for improving sales performance, with a focus on maximizing return on investment.
## Key Components:
- **Data Analysis and Preprocessing:**
  - Explore and preprocess historical sales data.
  - Identify relevant features and patterns crucial for accurate forecasting.
- **Sales Forecasting Models:**
  - Implement predictive models tailored to each store for department-wide sales.
  - Evaluate model performance and iterate for continual improvement.
- **Markdown Impact Modeling:**
  - Analyze the influence of markdowns during holiday weeks on sales.
  - Integrate findings into forecasting models for enhanced accuracy during holiday periods.
- **Insights and Recommendations:**
