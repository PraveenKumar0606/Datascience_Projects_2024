 # Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction

 ## Introduction: ##
 In this project, a predictive model has been developed specifically for forecasting the resale prices of properties in Singapore.

 ### Libraries/Modules Required ###
- import numpy as np: NumPy library imported and aliased as np for numerical computing.
- import pandas as pd: Pandas library imported and aliased as pd for data manipulation and analysis.
- import seaborn as sns: Seaborn library imported and aliased as sns for statistical data visualization.
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt: Matplotlib library imported and aliased as plt for creating plots and visualizations.
### For Regression Model and Classification model we have Various library and module from Scikit

### Approach: ###
- Understand data types and distributions, handle rubbish values, and treat categorical variables.
- Preprocess data by handling missing values, outliers, skewness, and encoding categorical variables.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize outliers and skewness.
- Engineer features, drop highly correlated columns, and visualize using seaborn heatmap.
- Build and evaluate classification models, optimize hyperparameters, and interpret results.
- Create a Streamlit GUI for interactive model usage with feature engineering and prediction capabilities
  
### Conclusion: ###
This project offers precise forecasts for the resale prices of Singaporean flats, along with insights into their availability, leveraging advanced machine learning methodologies. Through an intuitive interface, users can seamlessly engage with the model's predictions, empowering them to make well-informed decisions.
